# Late Pay Notify

Late Pay Notify is a tool that automates the process of notifying customers about overdue payments by sending email reminders.

## Key Features
1. **Notification Automation:** Automatically identifies overdue payments and sends email reminders to customers.

## How It Works
1. **Identification of Overdue Payments:** The system regularly checks the status of payments and identifies those that are overdue based on predefined criteria.
2. **Sending Email Reminders:** Once overdue payments are identified, the system automatically sends email reminders to customers, encouraging them to settle their payment status.

Late Pay Notify simplifies the process of managing overdue payments, providing an efficient and straightforward solution for notifying customers about their outstanding financial obligations.
